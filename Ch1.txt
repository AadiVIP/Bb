Long after Rudius had vanished into drink and comfort, Ren stole through shadows to the manor's back fields. There, under the indigo sky, surrounded by whispering grass and flickering lantern light, he moved. It began as awkward imitation-feet slipping in the mud, strikes falling short. But each failure etched improvement. Muscle memory took root. His stances grew steady. His limbs, once thin, flowed like water drawn through stone. Every repetition wore away the excess.

He wasn't just copying Rudius's movements.

He was refining them.

Even more unsettling was the presence growing within. A low hum in his core, faint but constant, like a breath held beneath his skin. When he matched his breath to his movements, the hum swelled. His limbs would tingle. A flicker of energy would pool behind his sternum, just shy of form-of something more.

It wasn't magic. It wasn't the Trials.

But it was something.

He didn't understand it. Not yet.

But he welcomed it.

The path ahead would remain brutal. Rudius had begun to sense his resilience and responded with sharper cruelty. The buckets filled with sand became buckets of stone. The swords dulled by time were swapped for warped, splintered iron. Tasks were given impossible deadlines. But Ren no longer bent. With each act of injustice, he carved meaning. Pain became discipline. Shame became steel.

On the thirteenth night of autumn, after a silent session beneath the stars, Ren sat cross-legged beside a dying lantern. His muscles trembled. His breath was steady. The world was still.

He stared into the dark, past the flickering glow, into a future he could not yet touch-but could almost feel.

They see me as nothing. A tool. A stepping stone. But what if I become the whetstone instead?

What if every drop of mockery, every strike, every scrap of knowledge-they all fed into their own undoing?

He flexed his fingers, feeling the lingering heat from the technique he'd just completed. It wasn't Rudius's form anymore. It was something more. Cleaner. Sharper. Instinctively... perfected.

A grin touched his lips, faint and fierce.

They won't teach me power.

But they'll show me enough to take it.

And in the silence, something within him stirred-no longer a flicker, but a low, steady burn.

A beginning.
